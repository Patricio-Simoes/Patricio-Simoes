# Patrício Simões

Hey there! 👋

I am Patrício, a DevOps Engineer currently working mainly with Linux, AWS, Kubernetes and Terraform.

I have a homelab that i use to play around with new technologies and try out fun things. It currently consists of a Beelink mini-pc, running Proxmox, backed up by a Synology NAS for storage. I plan on migrating this to a Kubernetes cluster on the future, (mostly for fun).

## Things i'm building 📖

**Linux Installer**

[The Linux Installer](https://github.com/Patricio-Simoes/linux-installer) is a project that i started for fun, i found myself with a need to automate the process of software installation on a fresh minimal install of Linux (Initially designed for Debian systems). 

This project offers a CLI interface using Python, alongside Bash to automate the process of setting up a new Linux instance with the software and configuration that the user has chosen.

**DevOps**

The [DevOps](https://github.com/Patricio-Simoes/devops) repository is where i store my notes and mini-projects related to technologies that i use or that i want to learn.

I have designed it to work as a knowledge vault, in fact, the whole thing is built inside [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to take leveradge of it's capabilities.

**Bash Utilities**

[Bash Utilities](https://github.com/Patricio-Simoes/bash-utilities) is a repository meant to store utility scripts for Bash. (E.g. A script that sets up Git, generating a new SSH key and configuring the user).
